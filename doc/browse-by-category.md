Browse categories using the list

The left side of every screen holds the category-group browser. It is a list of all category-groups  in which at least one ad has been placed. This means, that you can not find an empty category-group in that list. To get a list of all categories and groups of categories, you should enter the Category Editor.

When you click on the name of a group (e.g. Jobs, Services & Work),  you will see all ads in this group.

If you wish to refine the results, you can refine them by using a category name which is displayed within an ad, e.g. Gardens & Agriculture.

The view of this ad is exactly the same screen you get when you Search by keyword.
