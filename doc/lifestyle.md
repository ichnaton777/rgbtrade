# How to achieve a sustainable lifestyle?

The purpose of the Rgbtrade system is to help participants to lead a sustainable life.  This probably involves a garden to produce fruits and vegetables. Also, you may be a producer or reducer of goods such as textiles, wool or timber or you may be a craftsman or supporting local producers and reducers otherwise. This system can help to publish your ads to get the producer – user – reducer cycle going and account for everyone’s investment in your locally accepted RGB-currency.

## Pave your own path

There is no short cut or blueprint for a sustainable lifestyle. This is something anyone will have to accomplish during a multi-year transition, such as the action plans offered by the Transition Towns movement. Any sustainable lifestyle includes:

    * full recycling: whatever is produced is reduced and reused.
    * use of maximum solar power income
    * a sharing,  cooperative community

What’s there to trade if there is nothing to trade? The main problem of every  Rgbtrade participant is to get started. We all want that sustainable lifestyle but how can we as long as we are trapped in the I need money, I need work, I need time spiral’.

## Save time every day

First you should invest that scarce spare time in a useful manner. Watching TV or playing computer games may require less attention. Saved time comes to benefit the organic or permaculture garden you may start in your back garden or balcony. After a few years, when the soil has come to life and perennials have grown mature, your production may increase. But to increase your soil you may need a lot of organic waste which you just might be able to acquire locally as well. Please refer to other sources and your own inspiration and creativity to get started up.

## Brains inside out

In order to get in to the “right” way of thinking, it may be necessary to turn your own heads inside out. Usually, we are only limited by what we think is possible. The limits in our heads are the real show stoppers.

Unfortunately, this is not a documentation of How to remove the limits in your head, so you will need to find other sources to help you out….
