Overview of an ad
Search or list ads

There are two ways to find ads: use the search function or browse the ads by category or participant. In each of these cases, you will see a list of ads.
Overview of an Ad

The following screen holds a list of one single ad result. Let’s take a closer look at the contents of this screen.
Ad list detail - Results of search by keyword or category

Ad list detail - Results of search by keyword or category
No detail page

All information related to this ad is already on the screen. There is no “go to details” or “read more”, because everything is already here.
Group & Category

In the top of the add, the categories are displayed. It’s in the group Jobs, Services & Work and in the Gardens & Agriculture category. An ad can only be in one group and category.
Offers and requests

The next line says: requested: help in the permaculture garden. This means the publisher of the ads wants others to work in his garden. Otherwise, the text would have been something like: Offered: help in your garden.
Photo

If the advertiser has uploaded an image or photo, a thumbnail (=mini image) will be on the left side of the ad. If you click on the photo, the original image will appear.
Pricing

The offered price of this product or service is depicted under the RGB keyword, in the Red, Green and Blue colours. In this case, the price is R 1 G 0 B 0. Fractions are always displayed in multitudes of 1/8 (=0,125). Read more on this in the Prices section.
Advertising participant

On the right of the ad, you see details about the advertiser. Click on the participants name (in this case, ichnaton) to see his profile. Below the name is the location (in this case, Maassluis) where the participant resides. It is allowed but not desired to offer ads on a location distant from the participant’s home.
Ad number

In the right lower corner of the ad, the ad number is displayed. You can easily refer to this number on a later moment. You can just enter the number in the mail search form, choose search and the ad is displayed. If the ad has been removed by the advertiser, you can no longer see it.
