# Search by keyword

On the Front page, you can easily enter a keyword (e.g. egg) and then press the Search button. As a standard, you are searching for
Ads which have something to offer. You can switch to searching for requests or to searching for participants by clicking the corresponding keyword in the search form.

As an alternative, you can use the mini search form on the left side of every screen in the system. It works exactly the same.
