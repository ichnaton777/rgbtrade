# The purpose of RGBtrade  and colourcash

The purpose of the Rgbtrade system is to help participants to lead a sustainable life.  This probably involves a garden to produce fruits and vegetables. Also, you may be a producer or reducer of goods such as textiles, wool or timber or you may be a craftsman or supporting local producers and reducers otherwise. This system can help to publish your ads to get the producer – user – reducer cycle going and account for everyone’s investment in your locally accepted RGB-currency.

This is a quite general describtion. The every-day usage purpose is therefore:

* Provide an advertising platform for producers and reducers of organic and sustainable goods and services.
* Provide an economic monetary system to replace or  complement Euro or Dollar-based economies.
* To learn participants how to appreciate or estimate the value of goods and services using nature-based units.
